      <p>
         Pick-Up Game Planner, also known as PUG Planner, or PUP is a web application to plan, organize, and manage
         community pick-up game events. Users can register for game events, view rosters, and be assigned positions based on
         their preferred positions. The app handles a wait-list, a notification system, and includes functionality for admins
         to manage games and users.
         </br>
         The application was created in late 2022 as a capstone project to the NewForce coding school. The app was designed and deployed
         for a community of soccer players in Los Angeles.
