        Hi, my name is Shane. I am a software engineer who shifted from a
        12-year photography career. I've collaborated in teams using version
        control (Git), built front-end SPAs (Javascript / React), and wrote
        back-end services (C# / .NET). I have a passion for web applications,
        learning, and utilizing my skills to reach creative solutions. I also
        like to do other things: cooking up delicious meals, birding, and
        mountain biking.

              A web application to plan, organize, and manage community pick-up
              game events. Users can register for game events, view rosters, and
              be assigned positions based on their preferred positions. The app
              handles a wait-list, a notification system, and includes
              functionality for admins to manage games and users. The app was
              designed and deployed for a community of soccer players in Los
              Angeles.

              A web game that is played to create a five-meal meal plan. Users
              select a pre-made deck based on seasonal meal themes or their own
              user created deck. The two-round interactive game-play results in
              a final “hand” of five meal cards. The game seeks to help meal
              planning by reducing decision fatigue while remaining interactive,
              and customizable through user-created decks.
