            <p>
                What's for Dinner Poker is a web-based game that is played to create a five-meal meal plan. Users select a pre-made deck based on seasonal meal themes or their own user created deck. The two-round interactive game-play results in a final “hand” of five meal cards. Users have the ability to create, edit, and delete both decks and cards.
            </br>
                The game seeks to help meal planning by reducing decision fatigue while remaining interactive, and customizable through user-created decks.
